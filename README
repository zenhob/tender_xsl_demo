This is a minimal Rails application that demonstrates cross-site login with Tender.

I created it to test some single-sign on features in Tender, but thought a
demo might be useful to others. It took a couple plugins, one gem dependency,
a generator and a few lines of code. Total dev time was maybe 30 minutes.

To use:

  $ bundle install
  $ open app/models/user.rb # change TENDER_SITE and TENDER_SSO_KEY.
  $ rails server

Have fun.
